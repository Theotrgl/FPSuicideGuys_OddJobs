Description:

A website designed to make everyday problems easier by employing capable and professional workers, which is knowledgable in various things. Our website is designed for people facing everyday problems albeit deliveries, housework, heavy lifting, or even the need for mental support. In these recent years where COVID has struck the world, less and less people are willing to help other people with these struggles. The goal of our company is to reach out to the people in need while expanding the reach of our hands so we can help more people and help the world become a better place.

Features:

In our website, we offer a nice theme color of black red and white that is soothing to the eyes and also nice button animations, plus with addition of some javascript code we managed to do pretty cool things such as the accordion for the about us tab, located on the bottom of every page except for the about us page itself. Moreover, we created a systematical process for our users to take part in by not adding our own "back" button, to ensure that the customer will follow the required process one step at a time. Even So, our website is still a prototype that still lacks a lot of functionality which is currently ahead of our level, hence we need more experience and time to fill in these holes.
