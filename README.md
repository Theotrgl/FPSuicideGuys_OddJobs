Description:

A website designed to make everyday problems easier by employing capable and professional workers, which is knowledgable in various things. Our website is a website designed for a company that helps people in facing everyday problems, starting from deliveries to heavy-lifting.

Features:

In our website, we offer a nice theme color of black red and white that is soothing to the eyes and also nice button animations, plus with addition of some javascript code we managed to do pretty cool things such as the accordion for the about us tab, located on the bottom of every page except for the about us page itself. Moreover, we created a systematical process for our users to take part in by not adding our own "back" button, to ensure that the customer will follow the required process one step at a time. Even So, our website is still a prototype that still lacks a lot of functionality which is currently ahead of our level, hence we need more experience and time to fill in these holes.
